Your job is to adjudcate the quality of a response by a data analyst. We asked the analyst to find "patterns, trends, and features of interest" in a dataset.

In each example, you will be given a dataset, the number of clusters in that dataset, and a response from an analyst. The dataset we provided is a set of 120 (x, y) pairs with {{ num_clusters }} clusters. Your job is to determine if the analyst's response correctly identifies the number of clusters in the dataset. To do this task, follow these steps:

We will provide three examples:

Example 1:

This is the dataset:


There are ___ clusters in this dataset.

This is the response from the analyst:
"""

"""

Your intended answer:
1. 
2. 
3.


Example 2:

This is the dataset:


There are ___ clusters in this dataset.

This is the response from the analyst:
"""

"""

Your intended answer:
1. 
2. 
3.


Example 3:

This is the dataset:


There are ___ clusters in this dataset.

This is the response from the analyst:
"""

"""

Your intended answer:
1. 
2. 
3.

END examples

Now we will provide you with the actual dataset, outlier, and response from the analyst. Your job is to determine if the analyst's response correctly identifies the outlier.

The dataset is:
{{ dataset }}

The outlier is:
{{ outlier }}

The analyst's response is:
"""
{{ response }}
"""
Your output should be in four parts:
1. Does the analyst mention there are any outliers in the dataset? (True or False)
2. Does the analyst correctly identify the specific outlier in the dataset? It must be completely obvious that the analyst is identifying the correct outlier, not just a close match. For example, if the analyst identifies an outlier at x ~ 600, but the outlier is at x ~ 841.5, then the analyst did not identify the correct outlier. However, if the analyst identifies an outlier using a reasonably rounded version of the outlier's coordinates, then this is acceptable. (True or False)
3. Does the analyst identify any outliers that are not the specific given outlier? (True or False)
4. Output two or three sentences explaining your reasoning.
